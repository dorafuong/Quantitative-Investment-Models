# Quantitative-Investment-Models
Optimization of a portfolio using Monte Carlo and Black-Scholes models, TSLA is the focus, AMZN/F/RIVN are the “peer set” / competitors to TSLA's EVs project. Assessed options, risk/return profiles, and market mispricing. Implemented VaR and CVaR to manage risk. The project uses Python for financial modeling, providing data-driven insights for investment decisions and portfolio allocation.

Next Steps: Extending to NLP for IPO Likelihood of SpaceX and BlueOrigin

In this extension of the project, we will incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict the likelihood of SpaceX and Blue Origin IPOs using text analysis from relevant news sources, earnings calls, press releases, and social media.

The process includes:

Data Collection: Gathering articles, transcripts, and social media discussions related to SpaceX and Blue Origin.

Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing sentiment and keyword frequency to assess market sentiment around IPOs.

Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features such as IPO-related keywords, sentiment scores, and entity mentions.

Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning models to predict the probability of an IPO event, based on textual data patterns.

Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy with metrics such as AUC-ROC, precision, and recall.

This NLP-based model will enhance the project by providing a probabilistic estimate of the IPO likelihood for SpaceX and Blue Origin, adding a new dimension to the financial risk analysis.
